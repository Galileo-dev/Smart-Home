# Contents of project

- Company website source `artefact/CompanyWebsite/` - interface for company website
- Embedded Frontend website `artefact/EmbeddedSystem/frontend` - interface for the embedded system. connects to Embedded Backend
- Embedded Backend `artefact/EmbeddedSystem/backend/` - runs on the raspberry pi and is accessed by the Embedded Frontend website
- Report website `report/source/` - The report. written in markdown. `.md`

# How to run

## Requirements

NodeJs

## To run

1. locate your console and point to the root of the project containing the `src` folder and `package.json` e.g. `artefact/CompanyWebsite`
2. first run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.
3. next start the webserver with `npm run dev`
4. your console should tell you what URL the website is on e.g. `localhost:3000` open this in the browser

# File Structure

# Please be aware that all code written by me is located in the `/src` folders for each website needed to work with SvelteKit and svelte

`.svelte` files are the code. like HTML files but written in special syntax not much different from standard HTML and javascript

`on:click` adds an event listener and
the `on:click={}` is the function that it runs when clicked. an `on:click` with no `={}` is used to forward the `on:click` event to where the component is being used.

Any files or folders outside of the `/src` folder are generated by SvelteKit or are Config file used to assemble the website to its final form. this lets the website be reactive and server-side rendered. but I can assure you that everything you see and interact with is contained within the `/src` folder

Inside the `src` folder there are two other folders `routes` and `lib`.

`routes` contains all the url routes so `localhost:3000/contact` will show the `routes/contact.svelte`

A special route is the `__layout.svelte` this component is rendered on every route. it is used for parts of the website which are always seen, such as the navbar or notification panel.

The `lib` folder is where components are stored such as buttons and different elements for the webpage.

# Code structure

Each `.svelte` file is comprised of three sections.

1. script section denoted by `<script>` and this ends with `</script>` like a normal HTML file. any functions defined in here can be used within the HTML using `{()=>function()}`. anything in the HTML with `{}` brackets is referencing javascript.SvelteKit uses ES6 by default so the import statements are valid unlike the `require()` used in the Embedded system.

2. the actual HTML uses standard HTML tags such `<div>`, `<input/>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>` , etc

3. style section denoted by `<style>` and this ends with `</style>` comprise of all the CSS styles for the current **component only**. using the `.container` in multiple sections does not affect each other as they get scrambled by svelte on-site compilation.

There is a global App.css file that contains the colors used throughout the app and is distributed using a `var(--color-type)` where type could be primary, secondary, etc.

To better modularize certain parts of the app such as buttons and dividers which are used throughout the app, I put them in their own components. These are located in the `lib` folder. These are called components and can be imported with the es6 import function `import PrimaryBTN from '$lib/components/button.svelte';` and then used like an HTML tag which is self-closing `<PrimaryBTN/>`. This also makes apps less complex than their vanilla js and HTML counterpart while being fast and easily readable and SEO friendly.
`$lib` is a builtin variable to the `src/lib` folder.
