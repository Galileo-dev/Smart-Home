# Company and Embedded Website Design

The company website features a mobile-friendly design as does the embedded system frontend. this is done using the `@media` CSS style to sample the device screen size so as to use only certain CSS when device is small.

# Theme

I have coded the website in a way where all colors are defined in one place `App.css` this can be easily changed, this is done through CSS variables which allow you to define site global variable which can be used throughout the app. I could have added a button that changes the theme with a single click or follow the system theme but due to my strict deadline, I was not able to implement it.

# Accessability

theming is also important for color blind users who may struggle to see different themes so for accessibility purposes this will also be important.

Icons where used
to further allow the app to be used by many different people
e.g. people who do not speak English will still understand Icons which are use on the navbar for easy navigation.

This could also be expanded on by introducing many new themes for aesthetics.
