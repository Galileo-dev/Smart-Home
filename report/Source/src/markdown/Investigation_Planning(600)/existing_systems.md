# Existing Systems 

- [Nest](https://store.google.com/ie/category/connected_home) - used to control heating system

- [EcoBee](https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/) - used to control heating system

- [Philips Hue](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-gb/products/smart-ceiling-lights) - similar to my system but very expensive. requires special lights and a gateway but also provides a color setting.

- [Ikea Lights](https://www.ikea.com/ie/en/cat/smart-lighting-36812/) - cheaper then philips hue but is intended for a single light not an entire house
