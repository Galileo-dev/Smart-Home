# Improvements

## Embedded System / Product (Including frontend)

- In future iterations of this app, moving to firebase for more secure worldwide access to the embedded system and accompanied website would help.
- Adding a power consumption meter to show the user how much energy they are using and provide a summary every month.
- Add a way to add devices without needing to edit the config.
- Add a way for the frontend to automatically find the backend in case a certain port is already taken

This system can be widely expanded on to provide much more than a light control system. e.g heating, door open/close. the infrastructure and code are all there.

- turning the website into a mobile app or progressive web app to help mobile.

## Company Website

- The product page could be expanded on to add a cart and checkout system. the infrastructure for this would be provided by Shopify which is being used on many websites. this would streamline the buying process.

- the website could use some images of the product. i.e renders, drawings.

- firebase could be used to create a comments section for the product to allow people who have bought the product to give feedback.
